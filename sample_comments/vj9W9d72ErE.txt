Remember don't donate to any global humanitarian companies such as red cross, amnesty international and whatnot.
They take a huge share of donations for their own needs and there are even times that no money makes it to the cause. 

The actual first place to go is https://u24.gov.ua/ this is United24 
It is a platform presented by president Zelensky.

Secondly you might choose some volunteers that are helping Ukraine in various areas.

https://prytulafoundation.org/en 
Serhei Prytula foundation is one of the most known ones

Other well-known foundations are Army SOS and Come Back Alive
https://savelife.in.ua/en/
https://armysos.com.ua/

For Medical and humanitarian aids you have Leleka Foundations, Razom and United Help Ukraine
https://www.leleka.care/
https://www.razomforukraine.org/
https://unitedhelpukraine.org/

You can also see some people on twitter from different parts of Ukraine, but I cannot verify any of those, so do it at your own risk.

Suggested from Viewers. 
I personally did not have experience with these. But they look reasonable

Reply: HEY BUDDY, THANKS FOR AN INTERESTING REVIEW,  I AM SURPRISED YOU CANNOT SEE WHAT I SEE BUT HOW TO EXPLAIN WITHOUT GIVING THE GAME AWAY.  FIRST OF ALL IN THE EAST, ONE CAN NEVER UNDER ESTIMATE THE STUPIDITY OF THE RUSSIAN COMMAND NOR HOW LITTLE THEY VALUE THE LIVES OF EVEN THEIR MOST EXPERIENCED SOLDIERS (WHO ARE NOW MOSTLY DEAD).  FIRST REVEAL, RUSSIA HAS NEVER STOPPED MOBILISING, THE DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO BE SUBTLE, THEY TELL MEN TO GO TO THE ENLISTMENT OFFICE TO VERIFY THEIR DATA AND GET A DATE X MONTHS INTO THE FUTURE WHEN THEY CAN EXPECT TO BE MOBILISED.  WHEN THE MUGS TURN UP THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY MOBILISED.  ALSO THEY ARE GOING TO LOCAL EMPLOYERS AND GETTING THEM TO HELP THE RECRUITERS MEET THEIR "QUOTA" UNDER THREAT OF MOBILISING RANDOMLY (INCLUDING THE BOSSES).  THIRD THEY ARE CONVINCING THOSE THEY ARE ABOUT TO MOBILISED TO SIGN A CONTRACT, ON PROMISE OF MORE MONEY, BETTER HOLIDAY AND BETTER PLACEMENT TO 3RD LINE OF DEFENCE.  OF COURSE IT IS ALL LIES BUT THE MIUGS DO NOT FIND OUT UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE.  THE FOURTH ACTIVITY IS THAT THEY ARE STILL RECRUITING THE CONVICTS FOR USE AS STORM-Z, THEY ARE ABOUT AS CAPABLE AS BUNNY RABBITS, BUT THEIR GOAL IS TO REVEAL THE POSITIONS OF UKRAINIAN FORCES.  THESE SUPER MUGS ALSO FIND THAT IF THEY DO MANAGE TO SURVIVE THEIR CONTRACT IS EXTENDED FROM THE BASIC 6 MONTHS TO ANOTHER 18 MONHTS AND THIS CAN BE DONE UNLIMITED TIMES.   NONE OF US CAN KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS SAID IN THE RUSSIAN COMMAND TO PUTIN BUT THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE GOAL IN AVDIIVKA AND THAT IS TO FORCE REDIRECTION OF BATTALIONS DUE TO FIGHT IN THE SOUTH TO GIVE RUSSIA MORE TIME TO BUILD MORE DEFENCES IN THE SOUTH.  THE SECOND OBJECTIVE OF AVDIIVKA IS GET AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BEFORE THE WEATHER TURNS AND CULMINATION IS SET UNTIL THE SPRING.  THIS IS ALSO A MISTAKE FOR RUSSIA BECAUSE RUSSIA IS USELESS AT LOGISTICS IN WINTER, THEIR FORCES WILL BE SHIT AT DEFENDING WHILE UKRAINE WILL BE IN TRUE FIGHTING SPIRIT AND CONTINUE TO MAKE THE RUSSIANS PAY DAY AFTER DAY.  IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN THE MILITARY I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON KHERSON, I CAN ONLY SAY WHAT OUR PLANS WERE AND WE SPEND 2 TO 3 MONTHS DOING IT.  WE WERE SPECIAL FORCES WHO WERE SECONDED TO OTHER REGIMENTS TO LEARN OUR CRAFT. YES WE DID ALL THE USUAL STUFF OF BLOWING BRIDGES AND USING PONTOONS, BUT WE ALSO USED AGGREGATES  INCLUDING HARDCORE, SMALL ROCKS AND ROADSTONE DUMPED IN PARTS OF RIVERS, WE THEN BUILT WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL DIVERSION DAMNS, YOU CAN'T STOP RIVERS BUT YOU CAN DIVERT THEM FOR A BIT WHILE YOU WORK ON THE AREA YOU DIVERTED, YOU CAN USE EQUIPMENT TO PACK DOWN THE AGGREGATES AND EVEN DUMP LOADS OF CEMENT AND CONCRETE, YOU THEN RINSE N REPEAT, YOU ALSO DUMP AS MUCH AGGREGATE MATERIALS AS YOU CAN ALONG THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE WATERWAY,  LIKE A BRIDGE THE MORE YOU DO THIS THE MORE EACH SEGMENT MAKES THE NEXT ONE STRONGER.  OF COURSE IT CAN ALL BE BOMBED BUT IF (AND IT IS A BIG IF) UKRAINE HAS BEEN DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS THEN THEY WILL HAVE A HUGE AREA OF POTENTIAL CROSSING POINTS. SO RUSSIA JUST WANTS TO STALL UNTIL WINTER WHILE UKRAINE WANTS TO CAPTURE OR RENDER MILITARILY USELESS CRIMEA.  ONCE RUSSIA LOSES CRIMEA AND THE BRIDGE IS PROPERLY DESTROYED RUSSIA WILL BE HUMILIATED TO A POINT OF NO RETURN.  WHAT IS MISSING HERE IS MUNITIONS, EVERYTHING UKRAINE IS BEING GIVEN  IS 30 YEARS OLD, JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE BOMBS LANDING ON GAZA, LOOK HOW THEY TAKE OUT A WHOLE BUILDING, NOW PART OF THAT IS PLACEMENT BUT IT IS ALSO EXPLOSIVE POWER.  IF THE WEST WANTS TO SHORTEN THIS WAR THEY NEED TO GIVE UKRAINE EVERYTHING AND I MEAN EVERYTHING. EVEN JETS ARE NOT ENOUGH. THE LOGIC OF HOLDING AVDIIVKA AND EVERY OTHER LINE IS THAT IT PREVENTS OTHER CITIES AND TOWNS BEING MARIUPOL'S.  UKRAINE CONTINUES TO COST RUSSIA MORE LIVES, EVEN THOUGH UKRAINE IS ON OFFENSIVE. RUSSIA WILL NOT CONTINUE AT THIS RATE FOR 4 MONTHS, PROBABLY 2 TO 3 AT MOST.  THEY WANT THE WEST TO TIRE OF THE WAR AND PUSH UKRAINE INTO SOME SORT OF CEASEFIRE AND EVEN FOR THEM TO GIVE AWAY LAND, THIS MUST NEVER EVER HAPPEN. ALL IT WOULD DO IS GIVE RUSSIA TIME TO REGROUP, REPLENISH AND RETRAIN. ONLY FOR THEM TO COME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.  RUSSIA HAD A HUGE GEOPOLITICAL ISSUE WITH LACK OF YOUNG TO PAY THE PENSIONS OF THE OLD, THIS WAR HAS EXACERBATED AND ACCELERATED THAT.  IF ALLOWED TO TAKE UKRAINE THEY WILL NOT STOP THERE, THEY MUST BE DEFEATED AT ALL COSTS.

Comment: The Ukranians will wait for the ground to freeze across the Dnieper river and simply drive across to the left bank.  This will likely happen in January/ February.  If need be they will throttle the water flow by restrictions in the Dnieper river reservoir cascade.  This is where the isolation of Crimea will begin.

Comment: How long has Ukraine had to build up these defences. Apparently a few years. It looks like the Russians must be having trouble just maintaining this position.  How do they get supplies while so exposed to artillery.  Just like Bakhmut.  
 With  Kherson,  effective artillery support Ukrainian infantry may be able to advance without vehicles.  It is artillery and missiles that are the big killers. Not tanks and infantry.  Artillery with mines is even more deadly.  As we have seen.  Most of the Russian armoured vehicles we see hit are with drones or artillery.  Russians often not getting close to Ukrainian anti tank teams.  And Ukrainian spec Ops units crossing the Dnieper they have much better night vision gear. Russians have failed many times to clear the river banks.  Even using hypersonic missiles on the Ukrainians. I think the Ukrainian SOF units will take more ground.  They need to keep up the pressure. Even if they do not advance. So other units can win battles.  Ukraine is still intent on taking Crimea.

Comment: During the Vietnam War, the United States suffered a ton of casualties taking various strategic and tactical hills.  Eventually they would take these hills, but in the end lost the war because the costs were too high and unsustainable.  This is the end game for Ukraine.  Not to beat Russia head on, but to make the costs for Russia unsustainable. Unfortunately this takes years, but this is the way for Ukraine.

Comment: 10:00 "Political will"

It has always been thought to us in the Philippines that political will is a good thing. If I was still studying Social Studies, I'd argue this as an example of a negative side effect of "Political will".

Comment: 4:00 Ruzzia did this attack just before the rainy season, where no frontline movement happens. If you have to do a wasteful attack, just before a forced lull is the best time.
5:50 My best theory: Putin plans to "truce out", after having a bit of buffer created for Donetsk and other big cities.
Using his moutpieces in the West to cut support, to push it through.
11:00 It might be more feasible then for Ruzzia.
Ukraine might have modern bridge/ferry stuff like the "M3 Amphibious Rig". It is a 4x4, a ferry or a bridge - depending on what you need. As little as two of them can carry a MBT like Challenger or Leopard.
I think you recently noted the odditiy that ruzzian artillery is getting closer then their maximum range to the front. So chances are that any guns capable of hitting the transport are in range of counter-battery fire.
At minimum, it is extra pressure that force Ruzzia to keep more troops bound there. A river is a obstacle, that means you don't need as many troops to defend. A bridgehead meanwhile is basically a fully fledged frontline. More artillery heavy (to focus on disrupting supplies).

Comment: Putin needs at least get Donetzk city out of Ukraine artillery range to mainain any narrative of protecting  Russians in Donbass.
If Ukrainians will govern over that minority there is no negotiations stake to keep any territory of Ukraine at all. With no progress outof Donetzk front door it is all a moot argument to try freeze the conflict on the current frontlines. No one would buy it.

Comment: I have a feeling that the means of getting heavy equipment across the Dneipr might not be so much a new and innovative method as one which is so old that most people have forgotten about it.
Once you can get a strong rope across a river, it isn't much of an effort to connect rafts to that rope so that the rafts don't get swept downstream.  And if you can get one rope across, why not several, so you can pull the raft each way across.  You may think that using rafts for very heavy equipment is impractical, but the massive stones of which Stonehenge is built were transported to within a few miles of where they now stand by water, and if Neolithic Britons could figure it out, I'm damned certain that Modern Ukrainians can.    Those stones weigh on average 25 tonnes, so with modern materials and techniques Ukraine could comfortably quadruple that.  That is enough for even the largest Main Battle Tanks with  capacity to spare.  These days we know how much each item weighs, but those ancient Britons had no way of knowing.  Nowadays we know how much water we have to displace to support that much load - 1 tonne per cubic metre.   Nowadays we have to tools to easily construct such a raft, ferry or pontoon, instead of having to lash multiple hollowed-out tree trunks together to take the load and partition it sufficiently to make it almost unsinkable, especially if expanded polystyrene foam can be found to fill the voids.
The guide rope stays in place ready for the next load, beneath the surface and away from prying thermal imaging drones, and the power is on one or both sides, so can be largely hidden even on the bank, making night crossings pretty secure.  Ukraine may not have much of a Navy these days, but they did, and do have a pretty decent merchant fleet, and any sailor knows how to set up sheerlegs to load and unload a raft efficiently, even if it isn't already on the vehicle which will take it to the front, which it may well be.
We have become too used to the convenience of RoRo ferries and specialised military landing craft, but that is far from the only way.
It would not surprise me in the least if that was how they got some of the existing equipment across and in a few weeks there could be a regular ferry service in operation.
Not only quiet but invisible when not in use, it seems ideal to me.  And while the chance of hitting a rope from an aircraft may be non-zero, it would be tough ask and easily replaced as long as you already have spare ropes in place, sitting on the riverbed out of harm's way.

Reply: @@dgthe3 I'm afraid you are judging me by the standard of your own intelligence.  It is apparently a surprise to you that a rope-guided raft still works when the sun goes down, and if care is taken to avoid heat sources being radiated from the raft, would be invisible to the majority of drones able to operate at night (which, by the way, radiate a heat signature that is easy to spot and deal with using fairly basic civilian grade night vision equipment mounted on an automatic rifle or even one of the more powerful air rifles - there are plenty of videos online of pest control using exactly that method).
The ends of the ropes can be moved around on either bank and multiplied in number, so it is not going to be "in the exact same place, time and time again", as obviously, once you have a single rope across, you can have dozens of them spread over the 20km or so where Ukraine controls both banks.  With trips moving around within a 20km range (whether on one cable or dozens), it really doesn't qualify as the "exact same place", does it?
So as quietly as the river runs, you can get heavy equipment across, in pitch darkness and guided by the cable to the exact place the receiving party have set up to unload it.  Using a little common sense and moving the receiving end downstream of the sending end, you can even have the river current do most of the work.  With only a little more knowledge you can fit a keel-board or barge-board which would be capable of using the current to even move the raft upstream along its tether.
You don't have to be a rocket surgeon for any of this, and any ordinary seaman from the Royal Navy since about 1500 AD could set it up in a single night, with a few hands to assist (enlisted ranks started at a "hand" who when he could do all the everyday jobs associated with running and maintaining a ship in the days of sail would be made up to an "Ordinary Seaman", then an "Able Seaman" once they could be entrusted with overseeing others and coaching "Hands" towards becoming "Ordinary Seamen".  Finally all this culminated (at least for the best and luckiest of them) in becoming first a Bo'son's Mate and then hopefully THE Bo'son, who although he was not commissioned, was a true master mariner and even had the responsibility of training Midshipmen (the most junior rank in the hierarchy of commissioned officers) in the practical aspects of becoming seamen.
I explain all this to make it clear that it was only one rank up from a freshly enlisted or pressed hand that seamen were expected to have all those skills and more.  Yes, Officers needed basic knowledge, but their responsibility was to decide what to do, and the enlisted ranks' responsibility was to work out how to do it.
A naval ship in the days of sail was extremely complex, but a Bo'son could direct completely re-rigging it if it was damaged by either a storm or hostile action.  Any seaman could set up many current-driven rafts over the 20km stretch of the river that is available.

CBS News: "Ukraine never releases figures of their losses in the war against Russia. But since their counteroffensive kicked off, there appears to have been a sharp increase in casualties' So I wouldn't call that as 'advantage' so little gain for more looses than we know but - we all like to believe in something, right...

Comment: I have wondered why Ukraine wasn't using amphibious armored vehicles for this very tactic, specifically because it isn't as defensively entrenched by the Russians. 
Second question is why hasn't the former reservoir been crossed? Surely its dry enough by now.

Comment: I look at the UAF activity across the river in Kherson as another case of the shell game - which walnut shell hides the pea.  The orcs have to consider it is one more place they have to reinforce.  It is brilliant strategy by the UAF, particularly since Russian resources are constantly being whittled away in the east.  As you say, Georgijs, it is inevitable that a tipping point will be reached and it could happen very suddenly.   When it does happen, Putin's goose will be cooked!!!!

Comment: You could have said the same thing about the allies when they landed in Normandy. The reason Russia can‚Äôt do the same thing to Ukraine that they did to them in Kherson is because the Russians aren‚Äôt competent enough to do it. Ukrainians have had the initiative and momentum. Russians haven‚Äôt taken any new ground since the 1st month of the war. Only Wagner has had minor success and Russia eliminated them for Ukraine.

Is there a way for someone in the UAF to contact me? Or can you leave a contact  email address so I can contact them, so I can tell them this idea in private?

Comment: The answer you are looking for is Russia can't move anything to Kerson because then other areas are left unguarded.  Russia doesn't have the troops, artillery, helicopters, or even jets at this point to protect Kerson .  I think Ukraine has been slow in taking it, they need 100 Boats running 24/7 to ferry men and supplies.  Once the Kerson is taken everything falls apart fast for Russia.

Comment: My best guess is that Ukranian cross river logistics would be composed of highly mobile ferrying operations that don't stay in one spot for any length of time.  Russia used a small number of fixed bridge locations and even when it was forced to use pontoons it just deployed them in the same areas and would cluster large amounts of vehicles near thouse bridges making for easy targets.  Ukranian crossing would be spread over a 20 km wide region of the river with countless small boats at night moving supplies.  The heavy vehicles would get moved on individual bridge segments without assembling a whole bridge.

Comment: for the dnipro river.
1 aspect to consider: aviation.
Ukraine will ramp up their planes in the coming months.
they will be able to conduct some aerial attacks they can't today.

also, we know that the russian artillery intensity is lower and lower. they are not able to get enough shell.
their precision missiles are also low in stock.
and the ukrainian artillery as greater range and precision.
so with all of that, it may be hard for the russian army to control the river like the ukrainian army was able to do it.

maybe the ukrainian army will be able to cross the river with some fast moving vehicules.
able to cover good distance quickly and attack some russian keypoint while being protected by the artillery.

we'll see in the next days...

Comment: I think the purpose of the river crossings in Kherson is to force Russia into a dilemma. Russia already is too weak to secure the frontline in 2 massive hot spots and go in a full blown offensive in a 3rd hot spot. 
The river crossings are attempts to force Russia to divert forces away from Avdiivka and away from the Robotyne salient to push back Ukrainians in Kherson. If the Russians do this, the Avdiivka offensive is more or less over (Putler will not like it and place more commanders near windows) and the pressure on the Robotyne salient is reduced, while Ukraine probably has to give up the bridgehead in Kherson again. If the Russians continue storming Avdiivka as they are doing right now and want to push Ukrainians back in Kherson too, the Robotyne salient will become an open door. If the Russians don't chance anything, Kherson will stay the open door it is right now.

Comment: A wild guess: it seems that USA is rerouting ammunition destined for Ukraine to Israel with the current flare-up in Middle East, while concurrently Russia is receiving large amounts of North Korea artillery and ammunition. This might be tipping the scales against Ukraine on the Eastern front?
If Ukraine manages to cross the Dnipro in force and establish a big bridgehead, this might cause a huge diversion from the Southern front where Ukraine seems to have stabilized for some days now. Threatening Crimea from Kherson would be a major threat, and maybe (just maybe) could cut out Crimea from the rest of the front?

Comment: Sort of seems like you need some sort of cheap mass produced drone boat that can deliver a tank (or whatever mass you are aiming for).  Then there would be no specific target to take out.
How about a drone boat that is essentially a big inflatable sausage attached to a sturdy metal bar with an outboard motor at one end.
You attach two drones to the sides of a tank. The tank can still drive itself into the water because the sausages are higher than the tank tracks. At the far bank the drones can release their connection by remote control before the tank is fully out of the water and find their own way home.

(edit) another cute idea is that the tank and additional sausage could be mostly submerged for the trip. The surface might look like quite a small cargo. You could have another model that really was smaller and cheaper but looked the same from the surface so you don't know which is carrying the most valuable cargo.

(I think tanks can be substantially submerged without flooding?)

Comment: I think the AFU holds little hope for the left bank. But as far as I know they have already slowed the flow from 4 upstream dams & a rocky, shallow crossing is being exposed right now. If the russians don't see much to it either & send little help, a larger force would take whatever the russians give them. In other words, it could turn into something no matter what I think.

You state you are supporting Ukraine in her struggle great who would not and at the same time you are celebrating the defeat of PIS in the polish election and are telling us that a three party coalition is the great alternative .. lets look at it PIS manage to rebuild the poilsih army fix the economy and portect the borders ... and if all of this does not matter as they are internal affaris they were the FIRST to come out to support Ukraine on any meaningful basis ... with the current Tusk to be what would have happened I am convinced we would have seen another SCHOLZ trying to work with Putin on some civil rights for the Ukrainian minortiy in russia.  So really I cannot understand why you are celebrating another TUSK / SCHOLZ gownerment in the EU.  Please enlighten me. if you find the time.

Comment: 11:59. IMO 2 things:
1. Ukrainian counter battery is much better than Russia's.
2. Russia' s artillery tubes are so worn that they are trying to extend the life of each tube by limiting the max range of each gun. Thus forcing Russian artillery to have to be much closer to the line if contact that Ukrainian artillery.

Comment: Avdiivka is basically Bakhmut revisited.  Neither location was particularly important in a strategic sense once they became contested.  Bakhmut was prior to the beginning of the attack on it, but once it was effectively encircled it was just land - it offered no real advantage to the Ukrainians to keep it and nothing to the Russians to take it.  For political reasons tens of thousands of Russians were killed or injured taking it over the course of several months.  Avdiivka is the same situation - if Russia takes it they gain almost nothing and if Ukraine loses it they lose almost nothing.  It's all political on either side - plucky resistance vs unstoppable war machine.

Comment: What you need to know about the Terricon which will put pays to all of the Russian false claims and reduce any anxiety you may have about it .
It is an overburden heap from the coal mine so it is all of the stuff dug up & gone through at least the first crushing plant that was not coal
This is loose material with nothing to bind it together varying in size from dust to about a football and they are sharp edged.
As such it can not be dug into like a normal hill because the loose material will collapse without being reinforced and a trenching shovel will not do the job.
Next it was made by driving dump trucks up a single road that is as steep as the trucks they were using could climb then dumping the load over the sides.
So the sides are very loose and can not support any vehicle driving up as the sides will collapse, and do so regularly under their own weight.
In order to capture the hill the Russians have to come along the only road  by the rail line without being hit then turn their backs to the enemy and crawling up the hill so slow you could hit them with a bow & arrow let alone bullets without being hit 
Next , it is , as you have just pointed out with Avdiivka,  political not strategic  .
While it is tall and does have fantastic views, it is too high for tanks and too close for most artillery so that limits it to mortars & hand held weapons only .
Next as I have mentioned you can not dig in fortifications so a single shell and every one on top of there is dead  . You can confirm this by looking at the videos that showed the Ukrainian machine gun positions , they are in between mounds, not dug in and only machine gun placements, no artillery .
So Russia's only real advantage would be to have some where 25m high for electronics and a better view of dead Russians using binoculars .
If this was 1923 it would be strategic but in 2023 it is less of an advantage than a single high altitude surveillance drone .
So Russia has 2 problems .
First of all their generals are still using the 1942 Russian war manual to plan attacks and second they have hyped the Terricon so greatly they are now obliged to capture it to claim a victory . Which is why pro Russian channels have reported 3 times that they have captured this magical Terricon so a glorious victory is imminent .


As for Kerson if you go back through the lists of military aid there was a lot of amphibious assault vehicles big enough to carry the smaller wheeled tanks & IFV's .
These have not been seen any where and I would guess that Ukraine has them dispersed throughout the left bank because they move very quickly so can come from 10 mile away & get across the river in a few minutes under the cover of darkness and perhaps artillery fire then return leaving no trace other than wet tyre tracks as they return. 
I have only come across 1 mention of the slinger anti drone cannon which can be mounted onto anything so a couple of them on utes and drone attacks are greatly diminished .
The worry is the ariel bombs , Russia had been using FAB's of various sizes against the left bank for months and I have seen no evidence of any Ukrainian counter measures .
So we come back to the same old problem , unless Ukraine can hit Russian air bases up to 100 miles inside Russia there is no stopping the bombs .

Comment: F-16 and heavy cargo drones.  If each drone carries 10 Kg, and takes 30 minutes per trip, and you have 100 drones, that is 48 TONS of supplies per day.  The F-16s will be needed to keep aviation from attacking the drop zones.  The HZH Y100 TRANSPORT DRONE carries 100kg with a 90 minute flight time.  add to that the naval drone technology Ukraine obviously has, and I don't see any issues keeping an infantry force supplied.  Now, for heavy equipment, you're gonna need some fairy dust ü¶ÑüòÑ

Comment: On Bakhmut, no, not "fair enough" (imo). The ruZZian losses were extreme even then, and for what? A "city" that don't exist anymore surrounded by high ground in Ukraines favor that holds no tactical or strategical value for the ruZZians. I can't even see a political win. Even to Ukraine the value is very low wrt actual retake, except for continued attritional warfare against the troops in the "city" and those attempting to rotate, and maybe some political win.

And of course, coming soon... F-16s. It would not surprise me to learn that pilots have been secretly training on Apaches. Bridges that small will be able to be moved into place quick enough to get enough heavy equipment across to secure more bridges/pontoons/whatever.

Comment: The question is not can russia really put heavy firepower onto left bank and the river crossings, it is if they will. That is because to do that they would have to move resources in to the area and importantly into places that can now be hit by Ukraine with long range fires. And that is a lot of area that would have to be covered and hitting a cable going across a river or dispersed forces is not an easy thing from miles away. I do not see a major push in the West but I could see them pushing in enough to make any logistics coming out of Crimea be a roll of the dice and stress whatever forces guarding that long front feel very exposed.

Comment: I think the Kheron offensive is a good idea. If they were to transport the Marines in a massive night time advancement, they could get the jump on the Russians and push to the Black Sea cutting off part of the south completely from having a land bridge. Yes Ukraine would have the supply issues as you say, but with a larger area secured with only water around it except for one side, Ukraine could use this as an area to move in on the Crimean land bridge. It would take a lot of time, but it would certainly eat up a lot of Russia's offensive capability because russia would certainly do all they could to force Ukraine away from the Crimean land bridge. If Ukraine were fortunate enough to secure supplies enough, it would be possible that HIMRs could be brought across the river exacerbating Russia's trouble much much more.  In all it is a good play, and the chances of success in this way is probably better than 50/50. But even if Ukraine needs to jump back to the west of the river, the damage on russia would be much worse.

Comment: The biggest dangers for the river crossing are Artillery and Air-power, especially helicopters. Ukraine has been steadily attriting Russian artillery to the point where it is a shadow of itself. Ukraine out-ranges it, is much more accurate, and has a larger volume of fire. And recently, a HUGE dent in Russian airpower was made. That may well have created a window of opportunity for the Ukrainians to establish a proper bridge head, reinforce it and start to push out.

The Ukrainians proved that they can keep the Bridgehead across Antonivski, and that the Russians could not move them out of there. They will now link up the three bridgeheads and start pushing out to get the Russians ~10km away from the river. Then the crossing will be secure, and they will be able to bring heavier vehicles into the region.

Ukrainians will take their time, it won't be like the crossing of the Rhine by Patton, with pontoon bridges at several locations and heavy divisions fully supplied ready to jump across in hours, but we have seen what Ukrainian light troops can do. This war isn't decided by heavy armour anyway.

Comment: Georgie, I think it's as simple as this: Putin wanted a victory to take with him to see Xi. At any cost, he wanted so badly to say he had some recent success. Possibly he also told his Defense to stop the counteroffensive of Ukraine. What slowed (temporarily) the counteroffensive is throwing lots of human fodder bodies at Ukraine. Maybe he was thinking that doing this until it (hopefully, in his mind) gets too cold for Ukraine to do anything all winter so that he can rebuild another defense line like last winter. But, this winter is a lot different than last winter and it will go badly (hopefully) for Russia.

Comment: Putin‚Äôs Orcs are not too B-R-I-T-E and are like lemmings in many ways. Today on Joe Blogs YT show he demonstrated that Putin‚Äôs leadership has led to 87% losses in their economy from start to today! It‚Äôs even worse than that as most of Russia‚Äôs income comes from taxation internally! Has Putin‚Äôs decision for WAR resulted in anything positive? Putin is a terrible leader and his military mirrors his incompetence! Slava Ukraini üá∫üá¶ üá∫üá¶ üá∫üá¶ üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ USA üá∫üá∏

Comment: It might be the case that Putin (who has surrounded himself with "yes men" colonels) doesn't know the extent of the Russian military losses and believes them when they tell him they're making progress (and why wouldn't he believe them?). He therefore believes his army is in a position to take Adviika and the rest of Donetsk.

Comment: Getting the French AMX 10-RC across the river might be an option. They "only" weigh 16 tons, but are fast, mobile, have good optics and deliver a decent punch when used as fire support. If Ukraine has the additional artillery resources to support the operation from the right bank, then it's entirely possible that they can push the Russian artillery far enough back to get the river itself out of Russian artillery fire control. If that happens all sorts of impromptu bridges and dikes can be made to support a truly large scale offensive in the area.

Comment: The slag heap will be difficult for Russian troops to physically climb as the slag will shift and slide underfoot especially if it rains. It may have been built at a correct engineering angle  designed to be stable if left undisturbed. However if there are explosions the slope will be destabilised and landslides and collapses could occur endangering troops  climbing up from below. In essence it is  an unstable structure that should not be disturbed. Not ideal for wartime storming .

Comment: I was thinking a lot about past comments about Russia‚Äôs use of eastern Ruscist Federation ethnicities for filling their army ranks and I was thinking that this is a win/win for Russia.  It seems they are always interested in moving their populations into different areas of Russia.  So if they win with these soldiers‚Ä¶great.  And if these soldiers die en-masse before the mission in Ukraine is done, then they have more territory to move white Russia‚Äôs general population into.. thoughts?

Reply: When a river's banks are denominated with the terms "left" and right" it is always relative to its flowing direction, i.e. looking down stream, that is the usual way, so ruzzians are on the left bank. Otherwise it is better anyway to use geograhic directions, ruzzians are on the eastern bank.

Comment: Some very interesting points. The Russian command including putin do not value life and material. They appear to be intent of saturating various sections of the front with masses of soldiers and weapons in the hope of grinding the enemy until the opposing forces are spent. This l think is not new, l think they did this in world war two. The Germans failed thru lack of resources and poor leadership ie Hitler and of course of the issue in the west. I think the Ukrainian tactics have been outstanding and l think small but effective attacks have produced results.
The quality of the russian infrantry has always been poor and that will never change including their general staff . The russian military have been rubbish for at least since the World War 1. They have only succeeded with either from the weather, of oitside help. Another good example is when they got their asses kicked in Afganistan . I think  putin think he is stallin and he  was a fool as murdered the so called cream of the russian officer core. No change here.  I must admit that their troops are very good at murdering defenceless women and children. There been plenty of that.

Comment: This may be a stupid question, but can't Ukranians dig a tunnel under the Dnipro to move heavy equipment? This war will last for years, so there is time, and they can do the digging from Kherson, covered by buildings, so that Russians don't notice it. They would need to secure an exit zone on the other side of the river, hopefully under a bridge, so its not immediately obvious it's there.

Comment: "What prompted the attacks on Avdiikva?" Although I accept the theory of political goal setting by Putin and the top command, time is ticking away on Russia's ability to finance this war. The statistics published on the Russian Ministry of Finance's own website detail that Russia has been operating in an ongoing deficit since the invasion. They will deplete their reserve fund by the end of 2024 if they don't improve revenue collection. Forex traders are going to demand more and more lopsided exchange rates for the ruble as this financial hollowing-out continues.

Comment: You said in your live stream and you say in this video that you're not sure if Ukraine can cross the Dnipro, but it was reported that Ukraine brought a lot of pontoon bridges to their side of the river. I think them crossing it is very much possible, but the challenge is pushing outward so that they can securely maintain their logistics across the bridgeheads. Ideally they would also repair the Antonivsky bridge and push to secure Nova Kakhovka including the bridge. Crossing it likely won't be the issue; maintaining the operation is.

Comment: Georgie, these crazy meat waves are just like blowing the dam, it is a stalling attempt to prevent UA from gaining any ground, in hopes russian defense will be reinforced by the mud season. This will buy time in the winter for russia to build more and more trenches and lay mines. It also keeps an amount of UA troops from taking the offense. It's dumb, but... orc's gonna orc. Also remember what happened in '44-45, when hilter (deliberate mispelling) started ordering generals they lost their military analysis which spelled the end. Ontop of this there isn't just a maniacal motive, like you said there is politics ontop of it, so this is a double self inflicted orc foul.

Reply: These russian jets releasing gliding bombs don't get near to the frontline, simple manpads aren't sufficient. Something more advanced, like IRIS-T, NASAMS or even Patriot is in very short supply. These also have to be kept on the right bank, so their distance is even bigger. Not trivial.

Comment: I have been saying this for MONTHS!  Folks, how do you think we landed on Normandy beaches on D Day?  There were no bridges there either, and the ‚Äúriver‚Äù was a LOT wider!  Instead of Battleships, Ukraine has HIMARS on the friendly side. Avdeevka has been Battle of Kursk, or Stalingrad, consuming all resources for that front, weakening Kerson. It‚Äôs WW2 all over again. Just read your history and apply it‚Äôs lessons.

Comment: I have to say that your assessments and breakdowns of Ruzzian strategy and tactics are one of the best I've seen (next to Perun).  You have given me a different way to think about what is happening, past the basic 'who's winning and who's losing'.  Through your commentary I have been encouraged to actually look up Soviet ground strategy and use it as a template to view what has been happening in dramatic battles like Bakhmut, Vuhledar and now Avdiivka.  It makes a lot more sense now.  I thought that the Ruzzians where just stupid and suicidal but now I can see they are using a strategy.  To be clear though, the strategy is grossly outdated and is indeed stupid and suicidal for a war in the 2020's. Keep up the excellent work mate.

Reply: Once the dust has settled I would expect to see the Russian generals all say they advised Putin against the SMO but he insisted and they either had to follow or mount a coup.
This potentially could divorce Russia from reparations and have them awarded against Putins private wealth of $ 300,000,000,000 .
This would also be good because it would show China & North Korea what could happen to their leaders looted fortunes .

Georgie is up there, too! Paul, PERUN, Georgie and Denys all have good views and analysis on the Putler War against Ukraine! The thing with PERUN is he does not post regular videos on the Putler-Ukraine War. Anders from Denmark is another guy that knows his shit at the highest level! Artur Rehi is real good, too!!

Comment: There is an option that is a little complex. As the U is presenting 2 fronts in the beach landing operation one options for R is to pull resources from the Kinburn peninsula. If that would happened, the now established beach heads would be a fixing operation, not an assault. U would then launch the real operation further west cleaning out Kinburn P. Doing so they would have multiple launching and landing sites for heavy equipment.
Paramount would be to get anti aircraft guns as far East and South as possible. Manpads would do but longer shooting stuff would be needed as close to the river as possible.
The shaping operation would be HIMARS with some ATACMS followed by beach landings. Rapid deployment of as heavy equipment as possible would follow. 
Maybe the Swedish ARTHUR would be deployed as they are designed to go fast but also they can deal with sandy terrain. There is a lot of sand in the tree belts of Sweden. ARTHUR is also good at shoot and scoot.
I think Swedish ARTHURS backing up Swedish CV90 (also good in sand) Swedish NLAWS  and Ukrainian fighting spirit can make it happen.

Reply: The ruzzian use of Glide Bombs on the bridges is one of the biggest issues.  I don't know of any published added range they get on them.  JDAM published added range is up to 28KM.  So there would be a big need for Anti Aircraft systems with good range in the area to try and take down the launching platforms (hitting the actual glide bomb is probably not possible).  The KA-52s anti armor missiles may do significant damage to the pontoon bridges and they have a range of about 8km.

Comment: They are digging a tunnel underneath the Dnipro!!  üòâ It is not hard rock but soft alluvial soil.  A modern soil tunneling machines can exceed 200 m/wk (some as much as 700 m/wk)!  In this time is not digging only, but also reinforcing the tunnel continually as the boring machine advances. ¬†
So, a 3600 m long tunnel would be needed to drive heavy equipment from, say, Sadove, on the right bank of the river, to Pischchanivka, on the left bank, a town recently taken by the Ukrainian Marines.  Such a tunnel can be dug and rendered passable by heavy equipment in as short as 4 months!
A tunnel has the additional advantage to be taken out by aviation bombardment... while protecting the equipment and troops crossing it!  

With a sufficiently large bridgehead around the tunnel's exit, Ukrainian tanks and other heavy equipment could emerge on the left side of the Dnipro at the rate of a couple hundreds per hour, night and day!
Has anyone heard of a tunnel-boring machine having been delivered to Ukraine?

Reply: It would be very difficult to hide all the soil that needs to be moved. The Dnipro is a wide river, 400m to 1000m in places. Even if soil didn't accumulate near the entrances, there'd be trucks pulling up continuously to haul the soil away. Plus pumps would be needed to extract water from a tunnel, the pipes and discharge points would be another difficult operation to obscure.

Reply: @@Avo7bProject Assuming a tunnel 3600 m long (it has to cross much more than just the river, but also the marshes and secondary rivers of the left bank) and ca. 8 m in diameter (so that after concrete reinforcement, the heaviest equipment can use it), the amount of soil to be displaced would represent only an additional 18 cm on a 100 ha already mud covered area, following the Nova Kakhovka disaster.  It represents only 2-3 tons of slurry to be pumped every second into a river with an average flow of 1840 m3 per second (much more now that it is rainy season).  With its large mining industry, I am pretty sure Ukraine has all the slurry pumps needed!

BTW, does such a construction imperatively need to be concealed?  Not that tunneling work can be bombed!

Reply: What a stupid nonsense from someone who obviously hasn't got the slightest idea, just looking up some numbers from the internet. Tunnel boring projects usually take years of planning and minute probing and evaluation on what kind of geology you are actually expecting to meet alonf the boring path. Even if one was willing to take the risk just boring ahead with a viable probabillity things go awfully wrong, such machines are a very limited piece of equipment and cost a two-digit million amount of ‚Ç¨/$. Also you cannot just come crawling with the machine diving into the ground, you have to excavate a huge construction pit, setting up the machine piece by piece, which take weeks at best, rather months. This is totally unfeasable in the current situation. Why do people always come up with completely unsubstantiated stuff with no knowledege at all of what they are talking about thinking the are such a genius. Dunning-Kruger at its best.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ

Reply: @@st-ex8506 The entrance can get bombed. And, depending how deep you make it, any bits along the middle might also get bombed. But the really important part is that the exit can get bombed too. The part that you have minimal, if any, SAM or fighter cover for. Where all of your forces will have to pass through. 

Of course, that assumes that the machine making the tunnel wasn't bombed shortly before it breached. Because no matter how deep you dig, you've got to come back to the surface at some point.

Comment: A little criticism: We're on the Ukrainian side and our sentences should reflect that mindset. When you say the Russian are stupid because they attack well-fortified areas it sounds like wishing them to attack weakly defended areas and have a breakthrough. Of course, you don't mean that, but it gives a feeling that this criticism of yours is due to worry in case Russians make a breakthrough at a well-fortified Ukrainian position it will create a sense of losing among the supporters which by itself, seeing you thinking like that, is creating much bigger worry in me/us. I don't want to go much more in psychoanalysis, but that wording triggered my alarm.
I'm writing to shake you a little to pay better attention on how you say things because it's your videos that I never miss. I trust you more because you're a serious person and you don't do this for money.

Comment: I personally believe that if Ukrainians were able to try to take over the other bank of the river in Kherson, this would be a big blow for Russia, since they would be forced to send forces to the south to secure their positions. On the other side, in the Kherson area defence positions of Russians are softer than in the Zapo area. Actually, it would be the only place where the offensive is possible nowadays.

Reply: At least the various fields have treelines on the sides to assist with obscuring movement. The lake basin is just a wide area of grass and weeds, no decent cover. I'm not saying it's impossible - it is an unexpected direction of attack. But Ukraine would need something like a mass of their "Mad Max buggies" able to cross the area rapidly, and there remains the problem of getting across the Dnipro river.

Reply: You don't need air superiority there any more than elsewhere along the front. Being able to deny Russia free access to the area is sufficient -and doable. Air superiority would certainly make things easier. But SAM batteries are a thing, as are manpads. Its not perfect, but it will restrict what Russian aviation can do.

Comment: The mistake analysts make IMO regarding a Dnieper crossing is that they assume the bridge connections are critical to a successful crossing. In the Swedish army, for example, pontoon bridge segments can very easily be converted into rafts propelled by a series of boat engines attached to a fuel tank. Such a raft could easily transport a heavily armoured vehicle such as a tank across the Dnieper. 

Hitting a moving target generally requires local assets on the ground to help navigate a fighter jet's projectile towards its target. There will be no such assets to rely on for Russian aviation if the Ukrainians consolidate their positions on the other side of the river before bringing the armour across the river. Then, factor in the worsened response time of Russian aviation due to the arrival of the ATACMS and a crossing suddenly appears a lot more feasible.

Reply: It's not simply a matter of getting troops, vehicles, and supplies across the river but also keeping them from getting destroyed once they cross over. If you have a small bridgehead then it's easy for enemy artillery and aircraft to destroy your forces since they will be bunched up in a small area. So you want to capture a large area before you send over a lot of forces and heavy equipment. But how do you capture a large area without lots of forces and heavy equipment? That's the dilemma the Ukrainians have to solve.

Reply: @@HomegrownHydra No disagreement there. The question though is; what assets are the Russians willing to commit in such a scenario when the ATACMS are now an active part of Ukraine's arsenal? 

It's sort of a catch-22 in a way. Either the Russians use their combined artillery and aviation to try and crush Ukrainian advances across the river and risk losing those assets to ATACMS strikes, or they hold these assets back to a bare minimum with all the strategic risks this represents.

The main benefit of ATACMS is its range but Russian artillery were already in HIMARS range and their bases for fixed-winged aircraft are outside the range of the type of ATACMS that Ukraine received. It's the Russian helicopters that now have to be moved farther away from the front lines because of ATACMS.

Reply: No. The dirt & rock has to go somewhere when digging a tunnel. This was tricky to deal with in WWI, let alone today. And then you have the issue of the equipment needed to make the tunnel. You're not sneaking in a TBM after all. Maybe some mining equipment? Fine. How do you conceal the noise? People have been able to listen to tunnelers for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Triangulating the exact spot of the digging face would be trivial today. Next, how do you get out of the tunnel? Breach the surface of course. Great. So, do you put all your tanks & such into the incomplete tunnel, or do you breach and then send them in? Either way, they're sitting ducks for Russian aviation just in different ways. 

Tunnels are not a viable way to launch a mechanized assault.

Reply: @@dgthe3 You would not need a 6 lane highway.  And underground mines are dug everywhere all the time.  The equipment to dig would be available locally as there are plenty of mines in Ukraine.  Modern underground mines mostly have vehicular access wide enough for underground equipment.  I have been down a few, so I know.  The amount of waste removal could simply be disposed of in areas already disturbed by mines and artillery.  Regarding breaching the surface, it occurred to me that that might be what the bridgehead was for.  I am not an engineer, but as a geologist I have worked around mines, and it seemed unlikely, but feasible.  And the Ukrainian military seem to be quite capable of thinking outside the box.

Reply: That would only be about 200,000 casualties max though armour losses could be crippling. The Russians have boasted of being able to mobilise 40 million men and they would be happy to lose that number  so I would not count on a 4 month limit.

Reply: Even prior to the Avdiivka assault, ukraine was destroying Russian mechanized equipment faster than it could be produced and restored from reserve stocks. Those storage yards may contain mothballed armored vehicles by the hundreds, but the supply is still finite. Covert Cabal occasionally reviews satellite images of these sites, and just released a video estimating the attritional toll on infantry fighting vehicles, estimating this category to have approximately three years of deep storage remaining (once again, at pre-Avdiivka loss rates).

Comment: I feel like they are trying to secure the river enough, that artillery can't hit any bridges they build. With US support in equipment and knowledge, I am fairly sure they can build a lot of bridges quickly and get supplies across the river in mass. However that is pretty difficult if artillery can strike the bridges. If you get rid of the artillery, then you might be able to put a missile defense system down there and protect the bridges. Right now I think they are just probing, so I don't expect a big attack, but if they go hard, the situation will change quickly.

Reply: If it were just that easy
The Russians are using bombs on Kerson and have been doing this for months because they have been expecting these crossing to happen for months
The bombs can be launched from up to 100 miles away so basically over Russia itself & well out of artillery range.
A FAB 2000 only needs to hit 300 meters from a pontoon bridge & it is gone 
Russia has a lot of bombs so they could do 100 a day every day for months, if they had enough working planes & trained pilots and I feel that is their problem.
Back in the propeller days you can build 30 bombers a day, in fact Ford made a Liberator every hour 24 hours a day during WWII
However modern sofisticated jets take months even years to build and require more hours on the ground for servicing than every hour in flight.
Now Ukraine made the bulk of the engines and I sort of doubt they will be sending spares to Russia .
The West is not sending spares to Russia either which is why planes are crashing all over the place and the rate of crashes is increasing , even for Russian built planes .
What I am expecting to see is a lot of smaller bridges scattered all over the deltas minor rivers & streams so the amphibious assault vehicles can follow a dozen different paths from the Dinepro to the bridgeheads which you would want to do quickly.
They are all a lot quicker driving than sailing and once the hit the Dinepro Russia will be able to target them

Okay... I'll give you a technical hint: European *mobile* *amphibious* barges, as opposed to the *fixed* pontoons used by Russian forces.
If you can cross the sea between England and France or between Africa and France with tanks to kick some asses on great distances, you can cross the Diepr too. There are technical means designed specifically for this tactical issue, that haven't been shown yet during this war.

Reply: The main problem isn't the act of crossing the river itself, it's keeping the forces from being destroyed by artillery, aircraft and drones once they are on the other side. To prevent that you need a lot of controlled territory so you can spread out your forces so they aren't too vulnerable, especially from the glide bombs the Russians are using. But it's extremely difficult to capture that much territory before you've sent over a bunch of forces and heavy equipment. Thus the reason why the Ukrainians haven't done a large scale crossing in all these months. They need to either expand the bridgehead with small numbers of light forces or quickly land much more powerful forces and immediately expand the bridgehead at lightning speed, both of which are very challenging.

Reply: Its the transferring that is the major vulnerability. The boats need to be unloaded within the area of the bridgehead. At present, these areas can be hit by mortar fire let alone artillery or aviation. And the bigger the force, the more needs to be sent on a daily basis. So it creates a catch 22: to secure the bridgehead, you need more forces. But to support more forces, you need to secure the bridgehead.

Comment: Securing the bridgehead would require full control on aerial space, this is where ATACMS are now playing a huge role by pushing K-52s further away. Main troubles are coming from the SUs, Ukraine will get additional Patriot batteries, it's not impossible they move one or more closer to Kherson before winter, looks rather risky though. Artillery does not seem to be a big issue anymore, they have been depleting it using drones and HIMARS.

Reply: ‚Äã@@rogerphelps9939 Well China has at least one naval base in the Mediterranean and has been carrying out live fire exercise there in collaboration with the Russians. It is only a matter of time before they move a carrier strike group into it and may try and threaten the US CSG. I don't think that would end well for the Chinese.

There doesn't appear to have been much movement though - apart from Putins but his carers kept that under wraps.
Quite literally.

*‚Üì‚Üì‚ÜìHOW TO BELOW‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì*

Remember don't donate to any global humanitarian companies such as red cross, amnesty international and whatnot.
They take a huge share of donations for their own needs and there are even times that no money makes it to the cause. 

The actual first place to go is https://u24.gov.ua/ this is United24 
It is a platform presented by president Zelensky.

Secondly you might choose some volunteers that are helping Ukraine in various areas.

https://prytulafoundation.org/en 
Serhei Prytula foundation is one of the most known ones

Other well-known foundations are Army SOS and Come Back Alive
https://savelife.in.ua/en/
https://armysos.com.ua/

For Medical and humanitarian aids you have Leleka Foundations, Razom and United Help Ukraine
https://www.leleka.care/
https://www.razomforukraine.org/
https://unitedhelpukraine.org/

You can also see some people on twitter from different parts of Ukraine, but I cannot verify any of those, so do it at your own risk.

Suggested from Viewers. 
I personally did not have experience with these. But they look reasonable

Reply: HEY BUDDY, THANKS FOR AN INTERESTING REVIEW,  I AM SURPRISED YOU CANNOT SEE WHAT I SEE BUT HOW TO EXPLAIN WITHOUT GIVING THE GAME AWAY.  FIRST OF ALL IN THE EAST, ONE CAN NEVER UNDER ESTIMATE THE STUPIDITY OF THE RUSSIAN COMMAND NOR HOW LITTLE THEY VALUE THE LIVES OF EVEN THEIR MOST EXPERIENCED SOLDIERS (WHO ARE NOW MOSTLY DEAD).  FIRST REVEAL, RUSSIA HAS NEVER STOPPED MOBILISING, THE DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO BE SUBTLE, THEY TELL MEN TO GO TO THE ENLISTMENT OFFICE TO VERIFY THEIR DATA AND GET A DATE X MONTHS INTO THE FUTURE WHEN THEY CAN EXPECT TO BE MOBILISED.  WHEN THE MUGS TURN UP THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY MOBILISED.  ALSO THEY ARE GOING TO LOCAL EMPLOYERS AND GETTING THEM TO HELP THE RECRUITERS MEET THEIR "QUOTA" UNDER THREAT OF MOBILISING RANDOMLY (INCLUDING THE BOSSES).  THIRD THEY ARE CONVINCING THOSE THEY ARE ABOUT TO MOBILISED TO SIGN A CONTRACT, ON PROMISE OF MORE MONEY, BETTER HOLIDAY AND BETTER PLACEMENT TO 3RD LINE OF DEFENCE.  OF COURSE IT IS ALL LIES BUT THE MIUGS DO NOT FIND OUT UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE.  THE FOURTH ACTIVITY IS THAT THEY ARE STILL RECRUITING THE CONVICTS FOR USE AS STORM-Z, THEY ARE ABOUT AS CAPABLE AS BUNNY RABBITS, BUT THEIR GOAL IS TO REVEAL THE POSITIONS OF UKRAINIAN FORCES.  THESE SUPER MUGS ALSO FIND THAT IF THEY DO MANAGE TO SURVIVE THEIR CONTRACT IS EXTENDED FROM THE BASIC 6 MONTHS TO ANOTHER 18 MONHTS AND THIS CAN BE DONE UNLIMITED TIMES.   NONE OF US CAN KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS SAID IN THE RUSSIAN COMMAND TO PUTIN BUT THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE GOAL IN AVDIIVKA AND THAT IS TO FORCE REDIRECTION OF BATTALIONS DUE TO FIGHT IN THE SOUTH TO GIVE RUSSIA MORE TIME TO BUILD MORE DEFENCES IN THE SOUTH.  THE SECOND OBJECTIVE OF AVDIIVKA IS GET AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BEFORE THE WEATHER TURNS AND CULMINATION IS SET UNTIL THE SPRING.  THIS IS ALSO A MISTAKE FOR RUSSIA BECAUSE RUSSIA IS USELESS AT LOGISTICS IN WINTER, THEIR FORCES WILL BE SHIT AT DEFENDING WHILE UKRAINE WILL BE IN TRUE FIGHTING SPIRIT AND CONTINUE TO MAKE THE RUSSIANS PAY DAY AFTER DAY.  IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN THE MILITARY I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON KHERSON, I CAN ONLY SAY WHAT OUR PLANS WERE AND WE SPEND 2 TO 3 MONTHS DOING IT.  WE WERE SPECIAL FORCES WHO WERE SECONDED TO OTHER REGIMENTS TO LEARN OUR CRAFT. YES WE DID ALL THE USUAL STUFF OF BLOWING BRIDGES AND USING PONTOONS, BUT WE ALSO USED AGGREGATES  INCLUDING HARDCORE, SMALL ROCKS AND ROADSTONE DUMPED IN PARTS OF RIVERS, WE THEN BUILT WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL DIVERSION DAMNS, YOU CAN'T STOP RIVERS BUT YOU CAN DIVERT THEM FOR A BIT WHILE YOU WORK ON THE AREA YOU DIVERTED, YOU CAN USE EQUIPMENT TO PACK DOWN THE AGGREGATES AND EVEN DUMP LOADS OF CEMENT AND CONCRETE, YOU THEN RINSE N REPEAT, YOU ALSO DUMP AS MUCH AGGREGATE MATERIALS AS YOU CAN ALONG THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE WATERWAY,  LIKE A BRIDGE THE MORE YOU DO THIS THE MORE EACH SEGMENT MAKES THE NEXT ONE STRONGER.  OF COURSE IT CAN ALL BE BOMBED BUT IF (AND IT IS A BIG IF) UKRAINE HAS BEEN DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS THEN THEY WILL HAVE A HUGE AREA OF POTENTIAL CROSSING POINTS. SO RUSSIA JUST WANTS TO STALL UNTIL WINTER WHILE UKRAINE WANTS TO CAPTURE OR RENDER MILITARILY USELESS CRIMEA.  ONCE RUSSIA LOSES CRIMEA AND THE BRIDGE IS PROPERLY DESTROYED RUSSIA WILL BE HUMILIATED TO A POINT OF NO RETURN.  WHAT IS MISSING HERE IS MUNITIONS, EVERYTHING UKRAINE IS BEING GIVEN  IS 30 YEARS OLD, JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE BOMBS LANDING ON GAZA, LOOK HOW THEY TAKE OUT A WHOLE BUILDING, NOW PART OF THAT IS PLACEMENT BUT IT IS ALSO EXPLOSIVE POWER.  IF THE WEST WANTS TO SHORTEN THIS WAR THEY NEED TO GIVE UKRAINE EVERYTHING AND I MEAN EVERYTHING. EVEN JETS ARE NOT ENOUGH. THE LOGIC OF HOLDING AVDIIVKA AND EVERY OTHER LINE IS THAT IT PREVENTS OTHER CITIES AND TOWNS BEING MARIUPOL'S.  UKRAINE CONTINUES TO COST RUSSIA MORE LIVES, EVEN THOUGH UKRAINE IS ON OFFENSIVE. RUSSIA WILL NOT CONTINUE AT THIS RATE FOR 4 MONTHS, PROBABLY 2 TO 3 AT MOST.  THEY WANT THE WEST TO TIRE OF THE WAR AND PUSH UKRAINE INTO SOME SORT OF CEASEFIRE AND EVEN FOR THEM TO GIVE AWAY LAND, THIS MUST NEVER EVER HAPPEN. ALL IT WOULD DO IS GIVE RUSSIA TIME TO REGROUP, REPLENISH AND RETRAIN. ONLY FOR THEM TO COME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.  RUSSIA HAD A HUGE GEOPOLITICAL ISSUE WITH LACK OF YOUNG TO PAY THE PENSIONS OF THE OLD, THIS WAR HAS EXACERBATED AND ACCELERATED THAT.  IF ALLOWED TO TAKE UKRAINE THEY WILL NOT STOP THERE, THEY MUST BE DEFEATED AT ALL COSTS.

Comment: The situation on the Vuhledar direction is nothing short of astonishing. The massive influx of Russian forces into this area is challenging, with battles around Pryutne and the fields towards Rivnopil. Additionally, near Staromaiorsk, the occupiers are using artillery to target the village, attempting to advance closer. While the attacks have been repelled so far, the situation remains complex. There are also ongoing battles in the direction of Zolota Niva, renewed attacks in the Prychystivka area, and intense shelling. Furthermore, attacks were reported towards Poltavka, with the Ukrainian Armed Forces reportedly repelling all assaults. Let's show our support for the Ukrainian soldiers who continue to defend their territory despite the odds. What are your thoughts on the evolving situation in this region?

Reply: Are you an AI? My thoughts are that this war seems to be a forever war, Ukraine's hopes to reach the Sea of Azov might be 20 or 30 years away if this years movement of the frontline is any indication of the rate of movement. I feel that the reports from the media / social media are not reliable and that whatever it is happening geopolitically is not understood or predictable. But hope and positivity is strong here and I love that.

Reply: You should go and check out her channel. It‚Äôs strange that she and Georgijs are not on more or less the same page, with today‚Äôs reports. I‚Äôve grown to trust both of them. I‚Äôm confident things have got a lot harder today, but if I was a betting man, my money would still be squarely on Ukraine. If I had to guess, I‚Äôd say Georgijs is well aware of all the increased activity, but wants to analyse it properly, before reporting on it, because he likes to predict where things are going, while Mariia is more about what‚Äôs happening right now. That‚Äôs my hypothesis, anyway.
But don‚Äôt disrespect her. Mariia puts a lot of effort in and she knows what she‚Äôs talking about.

Reply: @@bradmodd7856 If you follow enough sources they do corroborate each other. You seem to have only looked at advances in territory, have you considered other aspects? 
The conclusions I have differently drawn from you is that this war will most likely culminate in 2025 or 2026.

What would you have written about UK in 1940? Looked pretty down and out. The war ended in 1945, it went 1939-1945, 5+ years.
No it won't be 20-30 years for Ukraine, or a few centuries on the basis of land advancement, for Russia.

Reply: Yes, that's an important point coming out of this war, and that's the relative lack of air support for both sides. It's even more curious the way Russis has deployed its overwhelming advantage in air power. Missed wiping out the air defences at strategic locations at the very start, missed whole airfields where the Ukrainian planes were sitting on the ground. Deployed troop transport with no cover, to sporadic use currently.
