I have 4 README's in the main folder for each of my 4 code files already. They have the instructions to run each code, and also the video I recorded shows how to run the 3 new code files. As for the description of each py file, I have the description written as comments at the top of each code file

Can check this for visualizing the output. https://youtu.be/SDw8uGt5lQY

A zip file of collected comments is stored at https://osf.io/r7gae/
